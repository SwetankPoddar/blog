All the code can be found at: [Github](https://github.com/SwetankPoddar/dynamic-instagram-gallery).

The script is currently hosted at: [https://instagram-gallery.swetankpoddar.me/](https://instagram-gallery.swetankpoddar.me/)

Instagram allows you to create a wonderful gallery for your pictures, however a drawback of Instagram is that they do not provide any way to integrate
the gallery into your personal website. The APIs require a lot of work, and it becomes really messy to use them.
